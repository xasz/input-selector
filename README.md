# input-selector

> :warning: THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Little project i am trying to do, after building a symasym.

## Goal
An simple but high quality input selector for stereo audio with 8 inputs and 2 outps.
There will be a rotary switch with an oled on the front of the device for the selection of the input and a button for th output selection.
Furthermore there will be a controller with full rest support for controlling the device.
